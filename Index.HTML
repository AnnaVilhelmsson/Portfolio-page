         <b><p> Hello! Its nice to see you here!
        My name is Anna, I am a hobby coding developer. 
        My plan is to educate myself in frontend development as a start and then later I also want to become a full stack developer. 
        I come from an background in Sales/customer service and customer success. 
        In this recent year I realised that coding is something that I really enjoy and now decided to make it into a career.
         I am currently doing self studies and Im currently looking for a good bootcamp/education in development. 
         I really love this and I am very willing to learn!
         Dont hesitate to reach out if you are interested into learn more about me.
          Lets meet over a virtual coffee.</P> </b>
